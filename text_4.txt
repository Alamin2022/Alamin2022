“Our main task is to produce cars in large quantities, at affordable prices and with high quality” – Bo Andersson, CEO of UzAuto Motors
Kun.uz correspondent interviewed UzAuto Motors CEO Bo Andersson about UzAuto Motors’ activities and future plans.
- I want to start our conversation with the issue of competition. As you know, customs duties have been reduced in Uzbekistan. How will this affect UzAuto Motors? How do you feel about competition?
- That’s a good question. I came here as a foreign expert to help develop the automotive industry. I am confident that UzAuto Motors can compete with any other manufacturer.
I believe in competition, it’s good to have competition! If there is competition, life itself will force you to be better.
I like the competition. I’ve always learned to compete with Hyundai, Kia and Lada. I am absolutely confident that our new product will be competitive.
